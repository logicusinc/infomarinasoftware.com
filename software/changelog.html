        <p><strong>Added – Invoice sent by email</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>In this new version, when an invoice is sent by email, it is considered printed, so it becomes automatically transferable in ACOMBA.
         In the previous version, the invoice had to be printed before it could be transferred to ACOMBA.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Added – In the list of invoices</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Under the "Invoicing" menu, "List of invoices", we added the columns, "Sent" and for ACOMBA users only the "Transferred" column. This allows you to quickly see the status of the invoices. 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Fixed - In the list of invoices</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>When sending an invoice by email to the invoice list, the selected position (client) in the list was not reflected so it was always the email of the first (client) of the list that was used. The correction has been made.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Added – A training mode is now available</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>The training mode is now more obvious. It was possible in previous versions to make a copy of the directory to allow users to use the application for training and testing. Nothing told users what version it was. This could be confusing. So now, just put in the infomarina.ini file of the training application directory and / or test the text, Training = 1, under the last line of text. Then all the main windows of the training version software will be displayed with a yellow outline.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Added – Creating a new client</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>In this new version, an identical validation, is carried out on the name, first name and on the name of the client boat. This will make it impossible to enter a duplicate client.
        </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Added – Reservation without site</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>In this new version, the slot assignment window for non-location bookings displays exactly the same information as when booking with site.
        </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Fixed - Description of product or service</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>When printing an invoice, some characters in the description of product or service were missing. Maximum of 50 characters. The correction has been made.

        <p><strong>Added – Temporary departure (draw coupon)</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>It is now possible to create and print coupons for every 24 hours of a related temporary departure. The coupons are then used to make one or more draws to thank the Clients who notify the marina of their departure. A draw is identified by its draw number. It is possible to finish a draw to delete the entries. A new print is automatically created with a new number. The number of the draw is included in the idenfactory of the coupon number. A coupon includes the coupon number, customer name, boat name, temporary departure date and date of arrival. </Br> </br> If a temporary departure is changed (abbreviated number of days) ) the number of entries (coupon) will automatically be reduced if the coupon list has not been printed. If the list has already been printed, nothing is done. The number of coupons is then greater than the number of coupons. </Br> </br> If the temporary departure is modified (increased in number of days) the number of participations (coupon) will be automatically increased if the list of coupon has not been printed.If the list has already been printed, the number of entries (coupons) is increased and a message is displayed to advise that an additional number of coupons has not been printed. </br> </br> Coupon and print management is available under the "Tools", "Draw" menu. </br> </br> Prints can be made manually from printed coupons or from a button "Make a draw" of the window. The winner is randomly selected from the entries (coupons) in the list.

      <ul>
        <li>Under the "Tools" menu, "Parameters", "General configuration", "General" tab, "Boats" a new "Minimum space between boats" field to allow the management of minimum space to respect. Then, to allow effective management add the adjacent platforms, under the menu "Management, Sites" new columns "adjacent slip". Following the selection of an adjacent slip, the width of the slip in the "Adjacent slip beam" column is automatically displayed in the column. When adding a boat to a slip, if the minimum space between the boats is not respected, a message will be displayed.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Added – Tenants tab</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>A new "Type" column with codes V, C, E. The codes are V for Visitor, C for Contract and E for Storage. A client may have a unique type or compound. Example: A client who is or has been under contract for the rental of a slip will have type C and if he has also been under contract for storage he will have the type CE. So if he has already been a visitor he will have the type VCE. This will make it easier to identify the type of client in the list.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Added – Invoicing tab</strong></p>
      <ul>

The summary displays the totals by account. The account description must be added manually from the "Tools", "Parameters", "General configuration", "Accounting", "Description G/L no. "if the" ACOMBA Communication "module is not activated. Otherwise the use of the new "Import descriptions from ACOMBA " button allows the import all account descriptions included in the list from the descriptions used in ACOMBA. The account descriptions used in the Sales report (Z) will therefore be the same.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Added – Impression of clients using temporary departure platforms (free sites)</strong></p>
      <ul>

      <ul>
        <li>Under the menu "Lists / Reports", "Sites", "List of sites / clients" it is possible to print the list of sites with client for a period. To display items in the list, the start date and the end date of the reservation and / or contract had to fall into the period of the start date and the end date of the filter. A new check box has been added to allow all reservations and contracts that also overlap the filter period to be displayed in the list. Example: without box checked start date from July 1 to July 31, 2014. Will be displayed in the list all reservations and / or contracts that have a start date and an end date within the period from 1 to July 31, 2014.

        <p><strong>Added - City Management Assistance (Includes cities for provinces: Quebec and Ontario)</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>A list of cities in Quebec and Ontario has been added to make it easier to enter a city name for a client. By selecting a city from the list, when editing and / or adding a new customer you will standardize the city name to avoid having your city written in multiple ways. This facilitates management, decreases errors and increases the efficiency of statistical reports.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>To enable this management, check the <strong> Automated Management of City, Province, Country, and Postal Code </strong> under the <strong> Tools </strong> menu, <strong> Settings </strong> <strong> General Setup </strong> <strong> General </strong> tab. In addition, it is possible when this option is enabled to choose whether data backup (cities, provinces, countries) should be <strong> ALL CAPITAL </strong> or <strong> Upper and lower case </strong>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Individual management of (cities, provinces, countries and postal codes) is available under the <strong>Clients</strong> menu, <strong> Address Automation </strong>, <strong> Cities, Provinces and Countries</strong> or option <strong> Postcodes</strong>. It is possible to add, edit, delete cities, provinces, countries and zip codes from this management. Note that if you delete a country all provinces, cities, and postal codes in that country will also be deleted. If you delete a province all, the cities and postal codes of that province will also be deleted. If you delete a city, all zip codes for that city will also be deleted.</p> 
        </li>
        <li>To gain efficiency and speed when entering client information, if you enter the zip code, city, province and country information is automatically added. So, always ask for the client's zip code before asking for their city. So when the city will be automatically displayed you can always confirm if the city included in InfoMarina corresponds to its actual city.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>For users of ACOMBA software with InfoMarina it is important to update ACOMBA clients following changes or corrections of cities so that both software have the same information. To update the ACOMBA clients via InfoMarina, use the menu in InfoMarina <strong> Billing </strong>, <strong> Acomba </strong>, <strong> Updating clients </strong></li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Unlisted Cities - You can validate unlisted cities in your client database by using the <strong> Unlisted Cities </strong> button included in the <strong> City, Province, and Country Management </strong> from the <strong> Client menu </strong>, <strong> Address automation </strong>, <strong> Cities, provinces and countries </strong> option. This button allows you to standardize all cities in your client base. Clients with non-compliant cities (different name than the name included in the list of cities) will automatically be displayed in the list. Then by clicking on the button <strong> View / Modify customer card </strong> or by double clicking on a customer of the list, the window of the customer card will be opened. To put, individually, the city according to the postal code of the customer record just click on the button to the right of the postal code (2 ARROWS) <strong> Assign the suggested address (CITIES, PROVINCES, COUNTRIES) </strong>. Then by clicking on the <strong> OK </strong> button, the window will be closed and the client will disappear from the list of unlisted cities. To batch update the cities according to the zip code of the customer files, simply select with the <strong> CRT </strong> or <strong> SHIFT </strong> button all the Clients in the list for which you want to update their city. Then on the (2 ARROWS) button <strong> Assign the suggested address (CITIES, PROVINCES, COUNTRIES) </strong>. Subsequently all Clients will disappear from the list of unlisted cities. </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Added - ARounding of Cash Payments (Withdrawal of 1 cent coin, Canada only)</strong></p>
      <ul>
        Thus, the total bill is rounded when the client does not have 1 cent coin (s) to pay the exact amount. The calculated amount to be remitted to the client is also rounded to the nearest multiple of five since traders can not re-issue 1 cent coins now. Borough management can be activated from the <strong> Tools </strong> menu, <strong> Parameters </strong>, <strong> General configuration </strong> <strong> Accounting </strong> tab. This management will manage this new specification, while taking into account the gains and losses generated by the rounding of the amounts of bills paid cash. To know the exact amount of the currency to give to the client during a cash payment. to come when available via ACOMBA, this management will allow the transfer of the rounding amounts in the district-specific account (cents) for the ACOMBA receivable account.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Changes - Sales report (Z)</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Added amount of rounding gains / losses (cents). Added a <strong> RESET </strong> column in the payments group. </li>

      <ul>
        <li>
